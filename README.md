# Challenge-02-Portfolio

## Description

In this challenge, I was tasked with creating a functioning, online portfolio that would be used to showcase my programming projects and skillset to potential employers.

## Acceptance Criteria

- GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
- WHEN I load their portfolio
- THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, -and how to contact them
- WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
- THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
- WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
- THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
- WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
- THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
- WHEN I click on the images of the applications
- THEN I am taken to that deployed application
- WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
- THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

## Changes Made

- Created portfolio application with internal links, a photo, projects I have completed, and methods of contact.
- Applied semantic elements and followed accessibility standards in HTML
- Internal Links within appigcation navigate the user to intended destination
- The section that displays projects contains links that, once clicked, sends the user to a deployed application.
- Applied media queries to ensure application is responsive to various viewports
- Applied DRY principle to optimize codebase and make it easier to read
